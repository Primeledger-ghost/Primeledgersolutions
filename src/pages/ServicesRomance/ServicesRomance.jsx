          <div className={s.twoCol}>
            <p className={s.muted}>
              Grooming starts with fast rapport, mirrored interests, and early
              emotional commitments. Scammers isolate targets to private
              channels and build ‘shared plans’ before introducing financial
              pressure: fees, travel costs, or ‘investment opportunities’.
            </p>
            <p className={s.muted}>
              Once money moves, they escalate with fake documents and doctored
              receipts. Blocking, gaslighting, and guilt follow. Preserve all
              evidence and act swiftly—time is crucial for off-ramp escalation.
