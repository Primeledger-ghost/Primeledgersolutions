              As a global market with many opportunities, it is hard to spot
              right or wrong incentives. Fake FX brokers operate under
              ‘influencer’ networks, create flashy dashboards, and push you to
              deposit more to ‘unlock’ withdrawals. They often block accounts
              once you try to exit or question results.

              Recovery involves strong evidence, timely notices, and expert
              escalation paths. The sooner you act after discovering the fraud,
              the higher the chance of successful recovery.
